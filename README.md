# 👋 Hello, I'm Anthony!

## 💸 FinOps Practitioner | ☁️ Cloud Analyst | 🐍 Python Programmer

I'm passionate about applying cloud cost transparency to infrastructure decisions. As a FinOps-focused cloud analyst, I specialize in extracting actionable insights from AWS usage data to help teams optimize resource usage and reduce cloud waste. I build tools in Python to make cloud efficiency measurable, visual, and actionable.

## 👨‍💻 What I Do

- 💰 **FinOps Analysis**: Detect underutilized cloud resources, quantify cost-efficiency, and recommend right-sizing strategies.
- 📊 **CloudWatch + boto3 Automation**: Scripted metric collection, visualization, and reporting from AWS services.
- 📈 **Cloud Cost Dashboards**: Build real-time dashboards using Dash/Plotly to communicate infrastructure performance clearly.
- 🐍 **Python Engineering**: Use Flask and Pandas to build reliable, data-driven tools for analytics and visualization.

## 🚀 Highlight Project: EC2 Cost Optimization Dashboard

An end-to-end FinOps tool to:

- Monitor EC2 usage via CloudWatch
- Calculate underutilization and estimate costs
- Compare instance efficiency (e.g., `t2.micro` vs `t3.small`)
- Recommend better pricing models (spot vs on-demand)

📍 Built using Python, Dash, boto3  
📊 Live summary dashboard with network + CPU graphs

_Cloud efficiency isn't just a billing problem — it's a visibility and strategy problem. I build tools to solve that._
